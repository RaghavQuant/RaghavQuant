Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Raghav Kohli from vibrant New Delhi, India.

As a Data Scientist, I'm deeply immersed in the fascinating world of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning. My passion lies in leveraging these technologies within the finance sector, where I bring a solid understanding of financial markets, econometrics, time-series analyses, and algorithmic trading.

Beyond the algorithms and models, I believe in the power of collaboration and shared knowledge. I'm here to connect with like-minded individuals, learn from each other, and work on projects that can make a difference.

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a finance professional, or just someone curious about the field, let's connect! Iâ€™m excited to share my work, exchange ideas, and create something impactful together.
